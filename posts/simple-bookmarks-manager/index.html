If so, you're not alone. Many people struggle to keep their bookmarks organized and accessible.</p><p>Popular browsers like Brave and Chrome offer a folder-based organization system, which can quickly become unwieldy. Even when resorting to searching through browser-specific URLs like <code>brave://bookmarks/?q=&lt;your keyword&gt;</code>, it often falls short because you may not remember the exact title or link.</p><h2>Bookmark's data structure</h2><p>At its core, a bookmark is quite straightforward. It consists of three elements: a title, a link to the webpage, and the action of opening that link. Here's a simple breakdown:</p><ul><li>Title: The name you've given to the bookmark (e.g., Google).</li><li>Link: The web address associated with the bookmark (e.g., <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>).</li><li>Open action: The action you want to perform when you click on the bookmark, which is usually to open the link.</li></ul><h2>Why not store your bookmarks in a text file instead ?</h2><p>This may seem like a simple solution, but it offers several advantages over traditional bookmark managers:</p><ul><li>Simplified Search: It's much easier to search a text file for a specific keyword than it is to search through a tree-like structure like a folder hierarchy. You can use a variety of tools to search and filter your bookmarks, including regular expressions and fuzzy search.</li><li>Version control: A text file can be easily tracked by version control. This means that you can easily recover your bookmarks if something goes wrong, or if you want to revert to a previous version.</li><li>Fuzzy Finding for Titles and Links: With this method, you can search for your bookmarks using either the title or the link. This is a significant improvement over traditional bookmark managers, which typically only allow you to search by title.</li></ul><p>Here's a simple representation of how it looks:</p><pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">Google |https://google.com
Youtube |https://youtube.com</code></pre><p>By storing this content in a file <code>$HOME/.bookmarks</code>, you gain the ability to track and search for bookmarks by title or link, all while maintaining version control. Additionally, macOS supports opening links in your default browser by default. And to make things even simpler, you can achieve all this with a single-line solution:</p><pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">bm</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"cat ~/.bookmarks |fzf | cut -d '|' -f 2 | tr -d '[:space:]' |xargs open"</span></code></pre><p>In short, using a text file for bookmarks is simple and effective. It makes searching easy, offers version control, and allows direct access to your bookmarks. If you need a practical solution for better bookmark management, give it a try.</p><div class="direction"><div class="previous"><a href="/posts/golinkname/">Go linkname directive</a> »</div></div></div></main></div></div><footer></footer></body></html>
